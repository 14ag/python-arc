Welcome to the world of Python After your first hour, you’ve likely learned about **variables**, **basic math**, **user input**, and perhaps how to **print** strings. 
 
Here is a classic "First Hour" challenge that combines all those elements.

## The Challenge: The "Dinner Bill Splitter" 
 
Write a program that helps a group of friends calculate how much each person owes at a restaurant, including a tip. 
 
### Your Goal: 
 
1. **Ask the user** for the total amount of the bill (e.g., 50.00). 
2. **Ask the user** what percentage they want to tip (e.g., 15). 
3. **Ask the user** how many people are splitting the bill. 
4. **Calculate** the total bill (bill + tip) and then divide it by the number of people. 
5. **Print** the final amount each person should pay. 
 
### Things to remember: 
 
* When you use `input()`, Python treats the data as a **string** (text). You will need to convert the bill and tip to a `float` (decimal number) and the number of people to an `int` (integer) to do math. 
* **The Math:** To get the tip amount, you can use the formula:

### Example Output: 
 
If the bill is **$100**, the tip is **18%**, and there are **2** people, your code should output something like: 
`Each person should pay: $59.0`

Great job on the first challenge If you’ve mastered variables and basic math, your next hour is likely spent learning about **If/Else statements** (logic) and perhaps your first **List** or **String manipulation**. 
 
In "LeetCode" style, the problem focuses less on user interaction and more on a specific **logical goal** with defined inputs and outputs.
